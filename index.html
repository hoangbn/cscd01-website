					I'm currently completing my Specialist in Software Engineering at the University of Toronto. I love problem-solving and learning new technologies, and I am fortunate to have been given the opportunity to demonstrate this at Geosoft Inc. and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. At Geosoft I worked as an Automated Test Engineer, testing their main product Oasis montaj, decreasing the average failure rate by 30% and presenting results at weekly meetings. At the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, I was a Neuroimaging Research Analyst, in which I designed and implemented my own preprocessing pipelines for diffusion imaging, and created a new pipeline tractify for tractography generation. I also have a deep passion for games. My experience with the medium has encouraged me to be an executive of the first ever Game Dev Club at the University of Toronto and develop a solo project Balloonatics. I aim to combine my programming skills, team player mindset, and love for games to be an indispensable asset to the game industry.

				<h2>Hoang Nguyen</h2>
				<p>
					I am in my third year at the University of Toronto Scarborough specializing in Software Engineering and minoring in Economics. I love everything about Computer Science but am currently focusing on exploring different aspects of Web Development. As an intern at FPT Corporation, I helped develop a new educational website that assists students with their studies by providing them lectures, practice exercises, exams, and analyses their weaknesses. I also devised a way to efficiently track and update some of the data inside the website, so that admin users do not have to do it manually. At Klick, I developed marketing emails and static websites to help pharmaceutical products get FDA approval, and get pushed to market. Some of the frameworks that I used on my internships and in my projects are React, Spring Boot, Express, Flask. Outside work and school, I like to do sports such as MMA, soccer, badminton. I also love playing video games and am currently trying to pick up game development as a hobby.

					I engage in work that feeds my curiosity. I often find myself busy with things, for which, I believe to have a big picture view. This is closest to the answer to why I chose to study Computer Science. At UofT, Faculty of Arts and Science, I got an opportunity to remediate a Major Incident affecting the CHASS Data Centre involving a large PostgreSQL database (1.6 billion rows) and its data definition. Working alongside another coop student, I was able to bring back the CANSIM Data Set at CHASS back live in under two months. I've learned and worked with a few web technologies such as Laravel, VueJS, Django, Spring Boot to use them during my work term and in my side projects. This helps me learn new technologies and frameworks much faster as I need them. I am open to ideas and collaboration, that will help me gain practical experience and utilize my skill set. I am developing a deeper interest in Machine Learning by working on some interesting assignments at UofT.
					<br><br>
					Additionally, I have worked at UofT Scarborough as Peer Study Skills Coach and Teaching Assistant for Introductory Programming course. I enjoy teaching things I have known to understand really well, this made me more efficient in the above positions and help me understand how a singular teaching style does not work well with students because of diverse learning styles.

				<h2>William Song</h2>
				<p>
					My passion lies in projects where I can make the world a better place. I have done this through
					work with organizations such as TEDx where I hosted an educational conference for my university. Another team I work with on one of my biggest projects is aUToronto, where along with a team of over 80 student engineers, I have been developing a fully autonomous self-driving car from the ground up under General Motors. While I am a generalist and a quick learner first and foremost, my primary expertise lies in systems engineering, software development, and online marketing. I am comfortable with most popular development languages (C, C++, Python, and Java) and a few less common languages and tools (ROS, Shell, and Verilog). My primary duty is as a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto Scarborough where I also work as a teaching assistant for a few undergraduate computer science courses.

			<h2>Architecture of Pandas</h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>First, we have a UML Package Diagram to show the overall structure of pandas:</p>
			<img src="images/deliverable1/overall.png" alt="">

			<h4>Pandas Object</h4>
			<p>
				In this structure, you can see that the majority of pandas is object-based. Pandas is focused around creating complex objects used for advanced data analysis, so a lot of its functionality is just creating those objects, and adding operations and extensions to supplement the objects.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some example PandasObjects that can be seen in this diagram are FrozenLists, NDFrames, and Blocks. These all inherit from the main PandasObject class, which we will get into more detail in the next section.
			</p>

			<h4>Operation</h4>
			<p>
				The Operations section has a main operation class, and is split into Unary and Binary Operation children. There is also a special MathCall operation child used for special math operations, but we did not include it in the diagram for simplicity. These operation classes allow pandas to extend the class of operations for scalability and use with other objects. We will also go into more detail on this in the following sections.
			</p>

			<h4>Extension</h4>
			<p>
				The Extension section is similar to the Operations section in that it allows pandas to define their own types for scalability. Some example types shown here are IntegerDType, BooleanDType, and StringDType. There are more ExtensionDType children that we are not showing here for simplicity, but the main point here is that pandas uses these types when constructing their objects for added functionality and efficiency.
			</p>


			<h3>Pandas Object and its extensibility</h3>
			<p>Next we have a more in depth look at the Objects section:</p>
			<img src="images/deliverable1/single1.png" alt="">
			<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
				This deeper look into the Objects section shows the types of functions and children PandasObjects can have.
			</p>
			<p>
				The children of PandasObjects each have functions that can be overridden by their children, and define what the object is used for. For example, FrozenList has a union and difference operation, defined exactly as a list union or difference operation in mathematics. These functions make it easy to see what an object is capable of and what each of its children will have/override.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, there exists subchildren for some of the PandasObjects. Some examples shown here are that NDFrame has DataFrame and Series subchildren, and Index has ExtensionIndex, MultiIndex, and NumericIndex subchildren. This shows that pandas uses inheritance to define more specific types of data structures and tools needed for their functionalities.
			</p>
			<p>
				*Note: There is an asterisk around Block because it is a more complex object we will go into more detail next.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Block Class</h3>
			<p>Now for a more in-depth look on what the Block class is about:</p>
			<img src="images/deliverable1/single2.png" alt="">
			<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
				In pandas, a block is an n-dimensional unit of a homogeneous type. It is used internally for holding values of a certain type, which is useful for managing analysis of several types in a programming language like Python.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main Block class has several functions that each of its children will inherit, like is_datelike(), internal_values(), and get_values(). These are all about getting information about the values that the Block is holding in some fashion, as that is its main role.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are several Block subchildren, such as DatetimeBlock, NumericBlock, and ObjectBlock. These can go even deeper as shown, branching off to BoolBlock, FloatBlock, etc. As you can see, pandas makes the effort to support different typing for clarity, which is useful for the wide array of data analysis that it is used for.
			</p>
		
			<h3>Implementation of Operations</h3>
			<img src="images/deliverable1/single3.png" alt="">
			<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
				Similarly to the Block section, the Operations section is split into different types for scalability purposes. It is also important to note that each operation is held as a string, as shown in the op string in attributes of Op.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like we mentioned before, there are Unary and Binary Operations that are the main children of Op. The Binary class has subchildren as well, splitting off into BinOp, and then into FilterBinOp and ConditionBinOp.
			</p>

			<h3>Detailed look</h3>
			<p>Putting it all together, we have a more detailed look between the classes in pandas:</p>

			<h2>Software Development Process: Kanban</h2>

			<h3>Description of the Process</h3>
			<p>We aim to make small, incremental changes to the Pandas project, for this reason, we choose Kanban as our Agile Methodology.</p>

			<h4>Why Agile</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The issues that we will be working on may not have everything laid out for us to complete, so we want to be able to adapt to change and new plans we make to complete any given tasks.
				</li>
				<li>
					We also want to embrace change pretty easily as it is good for identifying new tasks to complete in a large codebase.

				</li>
				<li>
					We want to recognize the fact that we have a small team of experienced programmers, and spending too much planning would be wasted and restrictive as we can figure our way around tasks easily.
				</li>
				<li>
					Finally, we want simplicity in our development as it would be easier for us to understand the scope of our contribution, and it would be more likely to be integrated into the main codebase.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Why Kanban</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The nature of issues we will be focusing on, align well with core principles of Kanban:
				</li>
				<li>
					Having a set of tasks visually represented makes it easier for us to take initiative and plan it out with other assignments.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Start with what you do know:<br/></strong>
							<div class="tabbed">Considering Pandas is significantly large Software being improved and modified by many developers, Kanban’s versatility and flexibility will make it easy to implement the workflow and follow contributing guidelines set by panda’s community.</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Agree to Pursue Incremental, Evolutionary changes<br/></strong>
							<div class="tabbed">Small changes to pandas due in next deliverable are the perfect candidate that will demonstrate minimum resistance to the ongoing development.</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Respect the current Process, Roles and Responsibilities<br/></strong>
							<div class="tabbed">Rather than developing a groundbreaking library from scratch ourselves, our aim is to preserve current processes in place for pandas. As contributors, we aim to set reasonable expectations while maintaining respect for the current process.</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Encourage acts of leadership at all Levels<br/></strong>
							<div class="tabbed">This principle especially aligns with the core principle of our team. We strive to achieve optimal performance in our tasks by leveraging each team member’s Strengths.</div>
						</li>
					  </ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					To fully follow the Kanban workflow we are using Github Project Boards set up Cards and necessary columns. This enables us to keep track of progress and contributions from each team member.
				</li>
				<li>
					Using Github Project Boards is the best choice since linking issues and pull requests directly to the card on the board is seamless.
				</li>
				<li>
					In addition to having accurate visualization of current work the Kanban board will allow us to maintain our focus on a specific number of tasks as we enforce WIP limits for cards in the in-progress column.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Pros and cons with other processes</h3>
			<p>
				Considering the requirements presented above we can conclude we have two primary methods to choose from - Scrum or Kanban. The following table summarizes pros and cons of choosing Kanban over Scrum:
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Pros</th>
					<th>Cons</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>Kanban focuses on development over the business</li>
							<li>Requirements are primarily created early while continuous. Because no “client” exists, there is no need to constantly revise requirements.</li>
							<li>Our contributions would not be large enough to justify a full plan-driven model of Scrum.</li>
							<li>Enforcing strategies that are strong foundations of Scrum is extremely difficult to manage as we might be working on different deliverables where tasks don’t transcend across several sprints.</li>
							<li>Kanban makes it easier to distribute work evenly.</li>
							<li>Kanban board columns can be adapted to fit our individual skill sets.</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>Kanban doesn’t support deadlines, will have to create our own on a person-to-person basis.</li>
							<li>Kanban is very similar to scrum so we will have to be careful.</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h4>Modifications to Kanban</h4>
			<p>
				Because of time constraints, it is not feasible to have Daily stand up meetings. As an alternative, we have a dedicated Discord channel where we report daily progress as each team member becomes available.
