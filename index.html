				<p>
					I'm currently completing my Specialist in Software Engineering at the University of Toronto. I love problem-solving and learning new technologies, and I am fortunate to have been given the opportunity to demonstrate this at Geosoft Inc. and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. At Geosoft I worked as an Automated Test Engineer, testing their main product Oasis montaj, decreasing the average failure rate by 30% and presenting results at weekly meetings. At the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, I was a Neuroimaging Research Analyst, in which I designed and implemented my own preprocessing pipelines for diffusion imaging, and created a new pipeline tractify for tractography generation. I also have a deep passion for games. My experience with the medium has encouraged me to be an executive of the first ever Game Dev Club at the University of Toronto and develop a solo project Balloonatics. I aim to combine my programming skills, team player mindset, and love for games to be an indispensable asset to the game industry.

				<h2>Hoang Nguyen</h2>
				<p>
					I am in my third year at the University of Toronto Scarborough specializing in Software Engineering and minoring in Economics. I love everything about Computer Science but am currently focusing on exploring different aspects of Web Development. As an intern at FPT Corporation, I helped develop a new educational website that assists students with their studies by providing them lectures, practice exercises, exams, and analyses their weaknesses. I also devised a way to efficiently track and update some of the data inside the website, so that admin users do not have to do it manually. At Klick, I developed marketing emails and static websites to help pharmaceutical products get FDA approval, and get pushed to market. Some of the frameworks that I used on my internships and in my projects are React, Spring Boot, Express, Flask. Outside work and school, I like to do sports such as MMA, soccer, badminton. I also love playing video games and am currently trying to pick up game development as a hobby.

				<p>
					I engage in work that feeds my curiosity. I often find myself busy with things, for which, I believe to have a big picture view. This is closest to the answer to why I chose to study Computer Science. At UofT, Faculty of Arts and Science, I got an opportunity to remediate a Major Incident affecting the CHASS Data Centre involving a large PostgreSQL database (1.6 billion rows) and its data definition. Working alongside another coop student, I was able to bring back the CANSIM Data Set at CHASS back live in under two months. I've learned and worked with a few web technologies such as Laravel, VueJS, Django, Spring Boot to use them during my work term and in my side projects. This helps me learn new technologies and frameworks much faster as I need them. I am open to ideas and collaboration, that will help me gain practical experience and utilize my skill set. I am developing a deeper interest in Machine Learning by working on some interesting assignments at UofT.
					<br><br>
					Additionally, I have worked at UofT Scarborough as Peer Study Skills Coach and Teaching Assistant for Introductory Programming course. I enjoy teaching things I have known to understand really well, this made me more efficient in the above positions and help me understand how a singular teaching style does not work well with students because of diverse learning styles.

				<h2>William Song</h2>
				<p>
					My passion lies in projects where I can make the world a better place. I have done this through
					work with organizations such as TEDx where I hosted an educational conference for my university. Another team I work with on one of my biggest projects is aUToronto, where along with a team of over 80 student engineers, I have been developing a fully autonomous self-driving car from the ground up under General Motors. While I am a generalist and a quick learner first and foremost, my primary expertise lies in systems engineering, software development, and online marketing. I am comfortable with most popular development languages (C, C++, Python, and Java) and a few less common languages and tools (ROS, Shell, and Verilog). My primary duty is as a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto Scarborough where I also work as a teaching assistant for a few undergraduate computer science courses.

				<p>
					I am a 5th-year co-op student studying Computer Science where I am specializing in Software Engineering. I have been coding since the tenth grade and hope to merge my love for visual arts and computers through web development. I am currently working as a freelance web developer, a Full Stack Developer at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine Post Graduate Medical Education, a Designer and Web Developer at The Soap Box Press and as a Peer Coach at the University of Toronto Scarborough Arts & Science Co-op.
					<br><br>
					I have previously worked at TD Bank doing web development work in Wealth, and at Verto Inc, where I worked as a Full Stack Developer. These two opportunities have allowed me to explore development in a professional setting, one with a focus on finance and the other developing healthcare software for many hospitals across Ontario.
					<br><br>
					I am proud to say I am a recipient of Apple's 2017 WWDC Scholarship, where I was 1 out of 350 people worldwide and only female Canadian that year awarded a scholarship to attend Apple's annual developer's conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California.

			<h2>Methods of Communication</h2>
			<p>Discord channel: acts identically to Slack but has free voice calls and screen sharing.</p>

			<h2>Communication Response Times</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A response to a directed message is expected within 1 business day of the original message being sent. The sender should tag the recipients (@name) for visibility</li>
				<li>All team members should review daily messages in the discord to keep up to date on the project</li>
				<li>For the 4 days leading up to a deliverable deadline, the response time is expected to be within 4 hours of the working hours</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Meeting Attendance</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Face-to-face: Weekly Mondays at 5:00 pm-5:30 pm only if necessary. It must be planned ahead of time. Attendance for face-to-face meetings is expected.</li>
				<li>Online: daily online standups in a channel where you note what you have worked on for that day (do not need to update if no work was done that day).</li>
				<li>Will will take notes</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Meeting Preparation</h2>
			<p>Face-to-face meetings will have a certain goal. You only need to prepare materials relevant to achieving that goal.</p>

			<h2>Version Control</h2>
			<p>Github will be used. Commit anything to non-main branches. The main branch should always be a publishable project. The code must be reviewed before merging into the main branch by at least one other team member.</p>

			<h2>Division of Work</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Upon analyzing and discussing each team member's strengths and weaknesses, they  will choose the work that aligns the most with their skill set</li>
				<li>For a situation where a team member is facing a significant learning curve for a task, they must reach out to a member who is most familiar with the task and get help. This must be identified by evaluating individual progress during daily online standups</li>
				<li>Work will be self-assigned at the beginning of every sprint and adjusted mid-sprint if necessary</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Submitting Deliverables</h2>
			<p>Everyone will contribute to writing deliverables. Julia will submit.</p>

			<h2>Contingency Planning</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Team Member drops: Notify everyone else ASAP and we will redistribute work accordingly</li>
				<li>If a team member acts against the interests of the team (misses meetings, doesn't do their assigned work, is academically dishonest) with no reasonable excuse: notify a TA or professor immediately for help from an instructor.</li>
			</ul>
